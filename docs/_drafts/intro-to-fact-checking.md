The autheticity of information has been a longstanding problem in the news industry, and society at large. Coupled with social media platforms acting as a catalyst for information spread, false, distorted and inaccurate information has a tremendous potential in causing wide spread casualties to millions of users in a matter of minutes. They have been used as an effective tool in smearing political campaigns, undermining the effectiveness of proven scientific pratices such as vaccination and causing widespead hysteria in the general public. What makes matters worse is studies have shown that consumption of such fake news makes it harder for most people to accept, or even consider the truth. 

Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Google have come under severe backlash from a number of critics on their ability to effectively counter the fake news epidemic, as they should! Since at the heart of their service lies an algorithm that personalises content based on the user itself. Almost all social media platforms are tuned to offer personalized search-based results that essentially create a *filter bubble*, an echo chamber that serves the reader with content biased towards their own opinions. This gives the platform a dynamic in which the readers only encounter information that confirm their pre-existing beliefs.

 To tackle this, a system needs to be put in place that can confirm the authenticity of any piece of information, almost instantly. Clearly a human based approach is neither feasible or scalable given the sheer enormity of the available data online. That leaves us with machines. A machine learning model makes it easier to detect patterns from previously flagged articles, and therefore detect new ones. Let's explore some possibilities by answering the following questions:

1. Does simply infering patterns from a dataset offer a robust solution to fact verification? 

2. Can we leverage evidence to help improve the classification process for a certain claim?

3. 

   

### Inferring Patterns from a Dataset

One of the most famous datasets for factual verification is the FEVER (Fact Extract and VERification) dataset
