Hey there, welcome to my blog! 

My name is Nihal D'Souza and I am currently a software engineer at Cisco Systems in Bangalore, India. I am part of the supply chain operations team where I develop and support certain web applications. These tools are employed by test engineers at manufacturing sites around the world. 

In my spare time, I usually work on projects or read data science related articles. Recently, I've started reading research papers and found myself thoroughly enjoying some of them! To make sure I understand them well, I've started taking down notes detailing my thought process. I've decided to publish a select few as posts on this blog in the hopes that others might find them equally intriguing. I've developed a liking in computational linguistics, mainly focused towards fake news detection in machine generated text. 

In my spare time I love cycling, listening to music and going on long runs. I am also an ardent Formula One fan who idolizes Lewis Hamilton.

Feel free to reach out to me over Twitter or Email, which can be found on the bottom left-hand side of the page. I'd love to collaborate on any project you're working on!

Here's my [resume](/assets/resume.pdf).
